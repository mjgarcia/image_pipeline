// description of parameters

unique_thresh
   Filters disparity readings based on a comparison to the next-best
   correlation along the epipolar line.  Expressed as a percentage,
   e.g., a value of 30 means that the best match must be at least 30
   percent higher than the second-best match.  Typical value is 30.



texture_thresh
   Filters disparity readings based on the amount of texture in the
   correlation window.  Expressed as a percent, e.g., 30 means that
   the texture must be at least 30 percent of the maximum value.
   Typical value is 30.


speckle_diff
   Groups disparity regions based on their connectedness.  Disparities
   are grouped together in the same region if they are within this
   distance (in disparity counts, i.e., 1/16 pixel) of a neighbor.
   Typical value is 10 (10/16 pixel).


speckle_size
   Filters disparity regions that are less than this number of
   pixels.  For example, a value of 100 means that all regions with
   fewer than 100 pixels will be rejected.  Typical value is 100.


horopter
   Offset of the search region for disparities.  By setting the
   horopter to a positive value, the cameras become more "cross-eyed"
   and will find objects closer to the cameras.  When the horopter is
   not 0, objects at large distances will not be found.  Typical value
   is 0.


corr_size
   Edge size of the correlation window for matching.  Values must be
   odd, in the range 5 to 21.  Larger values have smoother disparity
   results, but smear out small features and depth discontinuities.
